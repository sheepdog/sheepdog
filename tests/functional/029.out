Usage: dog vdi create [-P] [-c copies] [-a address] [-p port] [-h] [-r] [-v] <vdiname> <size>
Options:
  -P, --prealloc          preallocate all the data objects
  -c, --copies            specify the data redundancy level
  -a, --address           specify the daemon address (default: localhost)
  -p, --port              specify the daemon port
  -h, --help              display this help and exit
  -r, --raw               raw output mode: omit headers, separate fields with
                          single spaces and print all sizes in decimal bytes
  -v, --verbose           print more information than default
