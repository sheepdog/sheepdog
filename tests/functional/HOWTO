Running tests:
    - cd tests
    - For now, we need sudo or root privilege to run the test
    - By default, ./check will run all the tests
    - You can run selected tests: ./check 001 002 003
    - You can run a range of tests: ./check 003-009
    - Groups of tests maybe ran by: ./check -g [group(s)]
      See the 'group' file for details on groups
      For e.g, './check -g quick' run tests grouped as 'quick'
    - To randomize test order: ./check -r [test(s)]

To test zookeeper, you should set tickTime=500 first at zoo.cfg.
